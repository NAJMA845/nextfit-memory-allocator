# Memory Allocation Simulation: Next Fit Algorithm  

This project simulates memory allocation using the **Next Fit** algorithm. It allocates processes to memory blocks, starting from the last allocated memory block.  

## Features  

- **Memory Allocation**: Allocate processes to memory blocks using the **Next Fit** algorithm.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Styled input fields, buttons, and result display areas.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the initial memory state, allocations, and unallocated processes.  
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users about invalid inputs with clear error messages.  

## Technologies  

### Core Tools  
- **Java**: Programming language for logic and user interface.  
- **Java Swing**: For graphical user interface components.  
- **Java AWT**: For basic window creation and event handling.  

### Development Tools  
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE used for coding and testing.  
- **JDK**: Requires Java Development Kit 8 or later.  
- **Git**: Used for version control; project hosted on **GitHub**.  

### UI Components  
- **Swing Components**: Buttons, text fields, and labels for a clean interface.  
- **JOptionPane**: Displays error messages and notifications.  

## Development Process  

1. **Planning**:  
   - Defined requirements for the Next Fit algorithm.  
   - Designed a simple and intuitive user interface.  

2. **Design**:  
   - Used Swing components for inputs, buttons, and result displays.  
   - Focused on clarity and ease of use.  

3. **Implementation**:  
   - Developed the Next Fit allocation logic in Java.  
   - Built the GUI using Swing and Java AWT.  

4. **Testing**:  
   - Tested with valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper functionality.  

5. **Debugging**:  
   - Debugged using Visual Studio Codeâ€™s built-in tools.  

6. **Documentation**:  
   - Added comments to explain key code sections.  
   - Created this README for setup and usage instructions.
